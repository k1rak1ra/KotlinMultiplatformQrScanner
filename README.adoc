Kotlin Multiplatform QR code scanner


Reconstructed source code for https://github.com/Chaintech-Network/QRKitComposeMultiplatform, due to their refusal to release their source despite claiming it is MIT-licensed


Removed stolen QR generator code (Use the original: https://github.com/alexzhirkevich/qrose)


Added image picker support for wasmJs (Maybe if the original code was actually released publicly, I couldâ€™ve just contributed to it directly instead!)


Refer to original code for documentation
